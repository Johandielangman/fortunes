# Fortunes

I wanted to make my own fortune program, so I did.

![cowsay](/assets/cowsay.png)

Download the latest version of the program from the links below, or build it yourself from source.

| Platform         | Download Link                                                                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux            | [Download üîª](https://github.com/Johandielangman/fortunes/releases/download/latest/fortune)      |
| Windows          | [Download üîª](https://github.com/Johandielangman/fortunes/releases/download/latest/fortune.exe)  |

Then, in the same directory as the program, create a fortunes directory:

```bash
mkdir fortunes
```

Then, add your fortune files (`*.txt` files) to the `fortunes` directory. You can use the following format for your fortune files:

```
%
Fortune text goes here.
%
Another fortune text goes here.
%
```

You can have a look at the example fortunes in the `fortunes` directory of this repository, or at [JKirchartz's repo](https://github.com/JKirchartz/fortunes)

To get cowsay, google it. Or run `brew install cowsay` if you're on macOS or have Homebrew installed.
